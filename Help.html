<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p>
    Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
    This is a two player game played on a Square board. The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly
    capturing an opposing piece. The goal of the game is to get all of one's pieces into one group of pieces that are
    connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
</p>
<p>
    Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first. Each move consists of moving a piece of your color
    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which
    is then removed from the board. A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross
    enemy pieces, except one that it captures. A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total
    number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). This line
    contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on. A
    piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.
</p>
<p>
    The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is a path connecting any two pieces of that
    side's color by a sequence of steps to adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each of which
    contains a piece of same color. Hence, when a side is reduced to a single piece, all of its pieces are contiguous.
    If a move causes both sides' pieces to be contiguous, the winner is the side that made that move.
</p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<p>
    In this implementation of the game, the game is played by dragging and dropping pieces. The player playing a piece
    P (black or white) must click on a piece of that color and drag it onto a valid square to make the move. A winning
    message is displayed when the game is over - when either side wins or when the move limit is reached.
</p>
<p>
    The Game tab has options to start a New game or Quit the current game. A player can also undo moves (which undoes
    the last two moves, one move from each side).
</p>
<p>
    The Controls tab has options to change the Move limit and alternate between Auto and Manual commands for each piece.
<p>
    The LOA tab has options to display this Help message and the About message.
